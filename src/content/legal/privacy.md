## Privacy at blog.mykodelab.dev: Your Data Stays With You

Welcome to blog.mykodelab.dev. This privacy policy is refreshingly simple: **we don't collect your data**.

### What We Don't Collect

Unlike most websites you visit, we do not:

- Track your browsing behavior
- Use analytics tools to monitor how you interact with our content
- Store cookies on your device for tracking purposes
- Collect personal information like your name, email, or location
- Maintain user accounts or databases
- Use third-party services that track users across the web

### Why No Data Collection?

We believe in a web where privacy comes first. By not collecting your data, we respect your autonomy and right to read and learn without being monitored. This approach simplifies our operations and aligns with our core value: respect for our readers.

### Third-Party Content

Our blog may occasionally include:

- Embedded content from other sites (like videos or images)
- Links to external websites

When you interact with embedded content, those third parties may collect data about you according to their own policies, which we don't control. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any external sites you visit through our links.
