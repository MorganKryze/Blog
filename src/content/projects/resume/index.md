I forked this LaTeX resume template from jakegut's original project because I wanted something more customizable than the standard Word templates everyone uses. LaTeX gives you way more control over formatting and spacing, which is perfect for keeping everything on a single page without it looking cramped or messy.

The template uses pure TeX - no extra dependencies or complicated build processes. I made several tweaks to the original design to better suit my personal style and the types of positions I apply for. The biggest changes were around the section layouts and spacing, plus I added some custom commands to make updating different parts of the resume less tedious.

What I like most about this approach is that I can version control my resume like any other code project and generate consistent PDFs that look exactly the same across devices. It's probably overkill for most people, but if you're particular about typography and layout (or just tired of fighting with Word's formatting), having your resume in LaTeX is surprisingly satisfying. I've made it public in case others find it useful as a starting point for their own resumes.
