I built this email signature generator to solve the annoying problem of creating consistent, good-looking email signatures without fighting with email clients' weird formatting issues. The tool lets you pick a template, fill in your info through a simple form, and grab your signature as HTML that actually works across different email platforms.

The stack is pretty straightforward - HTML templates on the frontend with some Python scripts handling the processing and generation. I spent a good chunk of time making sure the signatures render properly in Outlook, Gmail, and other major clients (which was a bigger pain than I expected due to their inconsistent CSS support).

You can customize all the usual stuff - contact details, social links, profile pictures, logos, and colors. I made this primarily for myself and some colleagues who were tired of manually updating signatures, but figured others might find it useful too. Nothing fancy, just a practical tool that saves you time and headaches.
