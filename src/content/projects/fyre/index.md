[![Find Your Real Estate](/img/projects/fyre.jpeg)](https://fyre.vercel.app/)

I built FYRE (Find Your Real Estate) as an educational project to explore how data analysis can improve the property search experience. It's basically a simple Django site that visualizes various real estate datasets in a more useful way than typical listing sites.

The project takes several public real estate datasets and presents them through basic charts, maps, and filters to help understand market trends and property values. Nothing too fancy on the technical side - just straightforward data processing and visualization using Django and some Python libraries.

I made the interface multilingual since I wanted to practice i18n implementation, and kept the design clean to focus on the data insights. It's a small project that helped me learn about working with real-world datasets and displaying information in accessible ways. Mostly just a practical exercise in web-based data visualization rather than a full-featured application.
