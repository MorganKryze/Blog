I created ConsoleAppVisuals after getting tired of writing the same console UI code over and over in my C# projects. The goal was simple: make it easy to add menus, tables, loading bars, and other visual elements to console apps without all the headaches of managing cursor positions and text formatting manually.

The library abstracts away all the tedious parts of console manipulation - things like cursor positioning, color management, and input handling - so you can focus on your actual application logic. I spent a lot of time making sure the API is intuitive enough that beginners can create decent-looking interfaces with just a few lines of code, while still giving advanced users plenty of customization options.

What started as a personal utility has grown into something pretty comprehensive. Now I use it for everything from quick command-line tools to more complex text-based applications. It's nothing revolutionary, just a practical way to make console apps look good without having to resort to a full GUI framework or deal with the usual console limitations.
