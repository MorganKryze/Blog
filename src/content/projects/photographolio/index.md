I created this photography portfolio site to give photographers a clean, fast way to showcase their work online without all the bloat that comes with typical website builders. It's built almost entirely with Astro (about 95% of the code), which means it loads incredibly quickly and doesn't bog visitors down with unnecessary JavaScript.

The tech is intentionally minimal - just some basic CSS for styling (less than 4%) and a tiny bit of JavaScript (under 2%) for the few interactive elements that actually need it. I spent most of my time optimizing image loading and making sure the layout adapts well to different screens so photos look their best regardless of device.

It's really just meant to get out of the way and let the photography shine.
