This was my first real coding project ever - a console-based labyrinth game I built when I was just starting to learn programming. It's definitely rough around the edges, but it's what got me hooked on software development in the first place. I wanted to see if I could make something interactive using just a terminal window and pure C# without any external libraries or frameworks.

The program has a basic menu system that lets players navigate options, some data persistence so you don't lose progress, and procedurally generated mazes that are actually solvable (most of the time anyway). Looking back at the code now makes me cringe a little, but I'm still proud of what I managed to pull off as a complete beginner.

This project completely changed my trajectory - I went from casually trying out coding to becoming obsessed with computer science and software engineering. I've kept it public as a reminder of where I started and for other beginners who might be inspired to build something similar. It's not sophisticated by any means, but it represents that crucial moment when I realized I could create interactive experiences with just code and a text console.
